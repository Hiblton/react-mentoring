# Description

Create routing for your application (via React Router).

Add 404 (error page) and ‘No movies found’ page.
Link app states between each other with React Router.
By default, user lands on a new page with empty results state.
When user clicks on a film item, redirect them to: localhost/film/id.
Handle invalid URLs, display a 404 page, where user will be redirected in case of invalid URL. On switching search type or sorting type you shouldn’t switch any routes.
When user performs a new search, you should redirect them to: localhost/search/Search%20Query.
When a new user lands on the page with such URL, you should perform search and display results.
